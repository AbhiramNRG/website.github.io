    <p>Welcome! My name is Abhiram! I like to cube! My main is the RS3M Super with Maglev and Ball-core. My best time is 14.75 seconds and I average in the mid 20's. I don't do 2x2 as much, but I average 9 seconds with a best of 3 seconds. I want to get the X-Man Tornado V3 for my birthday because it's the world-record-breaking cube. I want to see other entrees here too so we can chat!</p>
